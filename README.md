A 25 year old, self-taught, software engineer from Raleigh, NC.

I prefer to write **back-end** code _(Rust, TypeScript, Go)_, but do front-end as needed _(React/NextJS TypeScript)_.  
**NeoVim** is my editor of choice. [dotfiles](https://github.com/TimothyCole/dotfiles)

_I have a pet ball python named [Mila 🐍](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17920168666864385/) but I don't program in python._
